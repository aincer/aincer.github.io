This Twine narrative is an interactive experience that explores the different laborious jobs that farmers took on during the Tudor era. The narrative begins with the player finding themselves in the middle of nowhere, and progresses into the player befriending a struggling farmer and assisting them to make some money. The player is able to make decisions and choose what jobs to take on as they are now a farmer themselves. However, these actions have consequences. Making the wrong decision and performing the task incorrectly can lead to making no money for the day. Money is important, you know! This story teaches the player information on the jobs the farmers took on to make extra cash to the last little detail, and includes videos within the experience to gain a fuller understanding. This game enables the player to learn about the farmers during the Tudor era and the ability to name themselves, their farmer friend, their sheep, etc as they decide on how to perform their tasks. This game contains some consequences, which is the reality that some farmers encountered during the Tudor era. If you fail to perform your job correctly, you’ll come home with no money for your struggling farmer friend. So in the end, this game is full of possible disasters such as being unable to support yourself. Including death, but hopefully you’ll make the smart decisions!
